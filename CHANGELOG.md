# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- Add platform presets and searchable setup (#142)
- Add model capabilities and usage insights (#143)

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Add shared budgets across duration windows (#141) — Existing allocation configuration writes require both expected revision fields; future writes also require confirmed expected_effective_at. Legacy reads, first creation, pause/enable and captured request settlement remain supported.

### Security

- **BREAKING:** Add MFA, passkeys and encrypted backups (#111) — New backup exports require a separate password.

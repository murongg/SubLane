# Third-party notices

SubLane is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only. Third-party components retain their own licenses.

## Shadcn Admin

- Project: https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin
- Revision: `e16c87f213a5ba5e45964e9b67c792105ec74d26`
- Copyright: (c) 2024 Sat Naing
- License: MIT; full text in `licenses/shadcn-admin.txt`.
- Adapted files: `web/src/components/ui/`, `web/src/hooks/use-mobile.ts`, and the `cn` function in `web/src/lib/cn.ts`. The application shell and `Session` menu follow the upstream header, sidebar, and NavUser patterns.
- Changes: component filename conventions, local import paths, bilingual accessibility labels, menu checkmarks and touch targets, and removal of the unused randomized sidebar skeleton. SubLane uses its own administrator session and business routes.

Go and JavaScript dependencies are pinned in `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `web/package.json`, and `web/pnpm-lock.yaml`. Their licenses remain available in their respective source packages. CLIProxyAPI SDK packages are linked as described below.

The Radix dropdown menu is pinned to 2.1.16 alongside Dialog 1.1.15 so they share focus-scope and dismissable-layer dependencies. Keep those primitives aligned when upgrading and verify keyboard focus in the account menu inside the mobile navigation sheet.

## chi and sqlc

- chi: https://github.com/go-chi/chi, version `v5.3.2`, MIT; full text in `licenses/chi.txt`. Used for HTTP routing over `net/http`.
- sqlc: https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc, version `v1.31.1`, MIT. Used during development to generate Go from SQL; the generator itself is not shipped in the runtime binary.

## Inter

- Project: https://github.com/rsms/inter
- Copyright: (c) 2020 The Inter Project Authors
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1; full text in `brand/source/OFL.txt`.
- Font source: Google Fonts, revision `1edf95b4328bc5997ca93d2c0c7205272ec7347f`, `ofl/inter/Inter[opsz,wght].ttf`.
- The unmodified variable font is included as `brand/source/Inter.ttf`. Brand graphics use outlined glyphs generated at the documented weights and optical size.
- Brand export tooling is isolated in `tools/brand`; it does not add a font or graphics renderer to the application runtime.

## CLIProxyAPI

- Project: https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI
- Version: `v7.3.7` (pinned in `go.mod` and `go.sum`).
- License: MIT; full text in `licenses/cliproxyapi.txt`.
- Integration: public `sdk/cliproxy`, auth/executor interfaces, `sdk/auth` Antigravity helpers, `sdk/api`, `sdk/config`, and translator packages. SubLane retains OAuth state, encrypted persistence, refresh orchestration, routing, and transport ownership. Codex/Claude OAuth parameters and provider metadata handling are adapted from this version’s MIT-licensed sources. Antigravity authorization and refresh reuse public SDK interfaces; Google installed-app client credentials are not duplicated in SubLane source.
- The SDK starts an internal loopback HTTP listener with all routes blocked, an empty credential registry, a no-op watcher, and automatic refresh disabled. Its CLI, management panel, Home mode, and Redis service are not enabled.

## Provider logos (Lobe Icons)

- Project: https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons
- Revision: `a94750e3f5f8fc33757b839d85030e742284e43a`.
- Copyright: (c) 2023 LobeHub.
- License: MIT; full text in `licenses/lobe-icons.txt`.
- Adapted files: `packages/static-svg/icons/codex-color.svg`, `claude-color.svg`, and `antigravity-color.svg`. They are bundled under `web/src/assets/providers/` and displayed by `ProviderLogo.tsx` with decorative accessibility semantics, retaining their original brand colors. No icon package or remote asset request is required at runtime.
- Provider names and marks remain the property of their respective owners.
